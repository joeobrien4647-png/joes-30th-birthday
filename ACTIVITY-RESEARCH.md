### Distance Reference from Ciron

| Wine Region | Distance | Drive Time | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Chinon** | ~99km | ~1h30 | Cabernet Franc reds, medieval town |
| **Vouvray** | ~115km | ~1h45 | Via Tours, sparkling Chenin Blanc in caves |
| **Tours (city)** | ~101km | ~1h40 | Gateway to Touraine wine region |
| **Sancerre** | ~200km+ | ~2h30+ | Too far for a comfortable day trip |

> **Reality check:** The major Loire wine regions are 1.5-2 hours from Ciron. This is doable as a day trip but it's a commitment. Chinon is the closest major wine area.

### Option A: Chinon Wine Tasting (~1h30 drive)
Chinon is the closest significant wine region. Famous for Cabernet Franc reds.

**Recommended Domaines:**

| Domaine | Group Size | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Chateau du Petit Thouars** | Groups welcome | Family vineyard 10 min from Chinon, wine tastings, tours, and picnics. [chateaudptwines.com](http://www.chateaudptwines.com/) |
| **Domaine Fabrice Gasnier** | Groups welcome | 35 hectares, organic and biodynamic. Good for large groups |
| **Domaine Charles Joguet** | Contact directly | One of Chinon's most famous producers |
| **Domaine Couly-Dutheil** | Contact directly | Historic Chinon producer |

**Pricing:** Typically 15-30 EUR per person for a tasting of 4-6 wines. Some include cellar tour.

**Combine with:** Visit to the medieval town of Chinon itself, lunch at a wine bar, visit to the Chateau de Chinon (fortress, Joan of Arc history, ~10 EUR entry).

### Option B: Vouvray Cave Tastings (~1h45 drive)
Famous for sparkling (Cremant) and still Chenin Blanc wines aged in troglodyte caves carved from tuffeau limestone.

**Recommended Domaines:**
- **Domaine Huet** -- One of the most famous Vouvray producers (+33 2 47 52 78 87)
- **Chateau Gaudrelle** -- Beautiful estate
- **Cave des Producteurs de Vouvray** -- Cooperative, good for large groups

**Pricing:** 15-30 EUR per person for guided tour and tasting

### Option C: Private Sommelier at the Chateau (No Driving!)
See Section 1 -- bring the wine to you. A professional sommelier comes to Chateau Roussignol with a curated selection of Loire Valley wines. 400-800 EUR for the group. **This is arguably the best option** since it avoids the long drive to wine country.

### Group Dining Strategy for 27 People

> **The honest truth:** Finding a single restaurant near Ciron/Le Blanc that can seat 27 for dinner is challenging. This is rural France, not Paris. Here are your realistic options:
>
> 1. **Book Restaurant Le Cygne privately** -- call well in advance, explain you're 27. They may close to other diners for you or set up a private area.
> 2. **Le Relais du Lyon d'Or in Angles** -- has a large room, combined with the village visit.
> 3. **Private chef at the chateau** -- honestly the best option for most dinners. See Section 1. Avoids the logistics of transporting 27 people.
> 4. **Base US Karting + Le V8** -- works perfectly for a combined activity + lunch day.
> 5. **Restogroupes** ([restogroupes.com](https://www.restogroupes.com/en/)) -- France's #1 network of restaurants that welcome groups. Search their site for the Indre/Brenne area.
> 6. **Contact Le Blanc tourist office** -- they'll know which local restaurants can handle large groups.
